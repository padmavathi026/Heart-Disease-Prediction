# Heart-Disease-Prediction
<h1>Prediction of Heart Disease</h1>

 

<h2>Description</h2>
The comprehensive workflow integrates advanced machine learning techniques and evaluation metrics to enhance early detection and prevention of heart disease, ensuring model reliability and interpretability.

Predicting heart disease using machine learning starts with data collection, gathering patient information such as medical history, lifestyle factors, and clinical measurements. 

This data undergoes preprocessing steps including cleaning, handling missing values, normalization, and feature selection to ensure quality and relevance. Various machine learning models, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), are trained on this preprocessed data.

Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation are applied to optimize model performance and prevent overfitting. The models are evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix to assess their effectiveness. Once validated, the best-performing model is deployed into a clinical decision support system for real-time heart disease prediction.
